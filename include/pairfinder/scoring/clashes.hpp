 * @brief Heavy-atom steric clash detection.
 *
 * A pair of heavy atoms overlaps when it sits closer than its minimum
 * acceptable separation:
 *
 *     min_ok  = kHBondFloorMinOk  when the pair could actually H-bond
 *                            (= kHBondFloor + kClashThreshold, so the first
 *                             charge lands at kHBondFloor)
 *                            (one side donates, the other accepts)
 *             = r_i + r_j    otherwise
 *     overlap = min_ok - d
 *
 * An overlap is only a CLASH once it exceeds kClashThreshold; below that it is
 * ordinary close packing and carries no penalty. Severity then ramps linearly
 * from the threshold to kClashSeverityCap:
 *
 *     severity = clamp((overlap - kClashThreshold)
 *                      / (kClashSeverityCap - kClashThreshold), 0, 1)
 *
 * so a contact that has only just become a clash costs almost nothing.
 * pair_clash() applies the threshold; worst_overlap() does NOT - it is the
 * feature-extraction entry point, and scoring its return value directly is a
 * bug (it charges score for ordinary van der Waals proximity).
 *
 * A donor/acceptor pair gets the H-bond floor rather than the van der Waals sum
 * because such a pair is *supposed* to sit inside vdW contact; only below
 * kHBondFloor is the distance physically impossible. Normal-range H-bond
 * distances are already scored by the `distance` parameter.
 *
 * The exemption is keyed on donor/acceptor CAPACITY, not on polarity: two
 * acceptors (carbonyl O6 and O4, say) cannot hydrogen-bond in any tautomer, so
 * giving them the H-bond floor hides a real steric and electrostatic violation.
 * Capacities come from HBondChemistry -- the same tables HBondFinder uses -- so
 * the clash rule and the H-bond rule agree on what is plausible.
 *
 * Hydrogens are ignored: modelled in only ~8% of PDB entries, so counting them
 * would make the result depend on whether H were deposited.
 *
 * Performance notes (this is the hot path):
 *   - element/radius and H-bond donor/acceptor capacity are resolved once per
 *     residue into a compact POD array, not re-derived per atom pair;
 *   - the inner loop compares SQUARED distances and never calls sqrt;
 *   - whole-structure detection uses a uniform grid (O(N)), not all-pairs;
 *   - the covalent-linkage test is two O(1) atom lookups, and the bond-graph
 *     walk only runs for the rare pair that is actually linked.
